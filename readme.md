# Computer Vision - FP11
IEEE Deepfake Detection Application.
<br><br>
## Deployment
Final model deployment uses the model from VisionTransformer.py. Model is deployed using Streamlit application to allow users to upload images effortlessly, which the model will classify as real or deepfaked.

## Dataset
Dataset is given by the IEEE Signal Processing Society as part of the DFWildCup: Deepfake Face Detection In The Wild Competition. The dataset is taken from publicly available datasets, such as Celeb-DF-v1, Celeb-DF-v2, FaceForensics++,
DeepfakeDetection, FaceShifter, UADFV, Deepfake Detection Challenge Preview, and Deepfake Detection Challenge, which are then identically pre-processed by the organizers for the competition. All images provided are labelled as deepfake or real images.
